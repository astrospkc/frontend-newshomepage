### What I learned

While doing this project I had difficulty while building responsive navbar , so I got help from youtube and learned how to actually implement it.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```tailwind-css -<div class="block absolute">


```

```js
const toggleMenu = () => {
  navbar.classList.toggle("hidden");
};
```

### Continued development

Responsive Navbar

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped about the concept of onclick method.
- [resource 2](https://tailwindcss.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand display.
