## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind css
- JavaScript

### What I learned

While doing this project I had difficulty while building responsive navbar , so I got help from youtube and learned how to actually implement it.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```tailwind-css -<div class="block absolute">


```

```js
const toggleMenu = () => {
  navbar.classList.toggle("hidden");
};
```

### Continued development

Responsive Navbar

### Useful resources

- [resource 2](https://tailwindcss.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand display.
